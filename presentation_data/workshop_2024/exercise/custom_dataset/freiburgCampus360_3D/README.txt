freiburgCampus360_3D  (REDUCED DATASET)
---------------------------------------

Scan_i_points.dat contains the measured 3D points in the robot coordinate system and the position of the sensor from which this point was measured. The order is sensorPosX, sensorPosY, sensorPosZ, pointX, pointY, pointZ.

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DATASET
-------------------------------------
The dataset was acquired on the campus of the Faculty of Engineering, University of Freiburg, Germany (79110 Freiburg, Georges-Koehler-Allee). It was captured using a wheeled
robot equipped with a SICK LMS laser range scanner mounted on a
pan-tilt unit. The pan-tilt unit was moved to acquire a 360 degree view of the surrounding. The scans were obtained in a stop-and-go fashion and it took our platform about 25s to capture a scan. The dataset contains 77 3D scans captured along a 723\,m long trajectory. The average distance between the captured scans was about 10m. Each scan consists of
150,000-200,000 points.
